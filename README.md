This is the first-ever assignment as a P-Hero student. 
This project has three main parts header, main, and footer. Each part has one or more sections I use comments to differentiate the parts and sections.
The header part contains a navigation bar and a hero section.
The main part contains five sections why-dev, current target, next target, inspiration, and support section. 
The footer part contains the footer line with some clickable social media icons.
